## About me

Hi! I am Antonio Victor Campos Coelho and this GitHub repository is my portfolio. Here I showcase a compilation of Python, R, Unix and other programming languages codes I developed for data analysis, statistical analysis and Bioinformatics.

I got my PhD in Genetics at Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil in 2017. I am involved with scientific projects focused in understanding the genetic factors related to HIV-1 infection, treatment, and therapeutic vaccine outcomes, exploring my great interest in Genetics, Epidemiology and Biostatistics and contributing to a better elucidation of viral, immunological and pharmacogenetics pathways involved in HIV-1 infection. I also have been contributing to studies pertaining to Zika virus infection.

In my GitHub Pages website, located at https://antoniocampos13.github.io/ I document usage of the code I deposited here.

## Organization of Portfolio repository

My portfolio is organized in folders according to **programming language**, which are **categories** on my GitHub Pages website, for example:

* Python
* R
* Unix

These folders include other folders, each one from a recent project or publication, which are sorted by date of publication followed by post title:

`YYYY-MM-DD_Title of the post`

So if you are reading some post in my GitHub Pages website and want to check the code, you know where to start! Go to this repository address:

https://github.com/antoniocampos13/portfolio

And find the folder corresponding to the post category. Simple, isn't it?
