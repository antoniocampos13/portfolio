## About me

Hi! I am Antonio Victor Campos Coelho and this GitHub repository is my portfolio. Here I showcase a compilation of Python, R, Unix and other programming languages codes I developed for data analysis, statistical analysis and Bioinformatics.

I got my Ph.D. in Genetics at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, Brazil in 2017. I am a post-doc researcher involved with a  project focused on whole-genome sequencing in the context of rare diseases diagnosis, exploring my great interest in Genetics and Biostatistics. Previously, I studied genetic factors related to HIV-1 infection, treatment (especially pharmacogenetic pathways), and therapeutic vaccine outcomes. I also participated in studies about Zika virus infection.

On my GitHub Pages website, located at [https://antoniocampos13.github.io/](https://antoniocampos13.github.io/) I document usage of the code I deposited here.

## Organization of Portfolio repository

My portfolio is organized in folders according to **programming language**, which are **categories** on my GitHub Pages website, for example:

* Python
* R
* Unix

These folders include other folders, each one from a recent project or publication, which are sorted by date of publication followed by post title:

`YYYY-MM-DD_Title of the post`

So if you are reading some posts on my GitHub Pages website and want to check the code, you know where to start! Go to this repository address:

[https://github.com/antoniocampos13/portfolio](https://github.com/antoniocampos13/portfolio)

And find the folder corresponding to the post category. Simple, isn't it?
